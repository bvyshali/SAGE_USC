This project demonstrates an automated way to scrape the Orbital launches table [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_in_spaceflight#Orbital_launches) and count successful/failed launches by date. Since the table contains irregular number of rows across tables, missing entries and merged cells, this was more challenging than scraping regular tables.
